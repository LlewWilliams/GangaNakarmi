This code was used in collecting data for this research paper:
   "A crowdsourced approach to documenting usersâ€™ preferences for landscape attributes in the proposed Appalachian Geopark Region in West Virginia"

This was used to download a set of jpg images from Flickr. 
The desired image names and urls were placed in a csv file for processing beforehand.
