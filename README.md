# Running the code
This is a python workflow that requires the installation of some third-party libraries, some of them are older versions. We recommend that you use a virtual environment and the conda platform for installing and managing dependencies. We used Google colab to increase performance. We used Visual Studio code for editing, though that is not a requirement. Reproducing the results in the paper will require some experience with coding and running python scripts. No sample data has been provided.
